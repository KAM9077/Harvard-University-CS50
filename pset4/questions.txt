0.  GIF 256 / BMP 256 /PNG 16 million colors / JPEG 16 million colors.
1.  GIf format
2.  Lossy compression: we don't get exactly the same thing back out of the file that we thought we put in
    Lossless compression:  we can read back out of the file exactly the same data that we wrote into it.
3.  JPEG format
4   The system remove the file’s reference from the containing directory, The file’s blocks are then placed on the free list
5.  Erases directory metadata. Sanitizes Windows swap file when run from DOS. Sanitizes slack space by creating huge temporary files
6   its a header file that provides access to several functions related to integer standards like uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t
    They specify the exact width of integers.
7.  uint8_t: is for define an unsined integer with 8 bite/ uint32_t:is for define an unsined integer with 32 bite
    int32_t:is for define a sined integer with 32 bite/ uint16_t:is for define an unsined integer with 16 bite.
8.  Byte: 1 /DWORD: 4/  LONG: 4/ WORD: 2.
9.  The header field used to identify the BMP and DIB file is 0x42 0x4D in hexadecimal, same as BM in ASCII
10. bfSize describes the entire file size in bytes, biSize describes the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER in bytes,
11. TODO
12. biBitCount.
13. fopen will return null if it cannot open the file if there isn't enough memory or the file cannot be found.
14. The third argument determines the number of elements fread will read So this argument is always 1 because we are always reading for file.
15. 1
16. fseek moves the file position indicator.
17. SEEK_CUR is an option used in fseek to set the offset relative to the current pointer position.
18. it is a man but i dont who is.
